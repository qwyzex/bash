# qxBash

## At a glance
This simple shell script will clear the regular "SDK Message" in Git SDK Terminal, and greet you with every new terminal session. It also come with pre-build `.bashrc` aliases (Optional)

## Usage
To use this script, cd to where you want to clone it. Then clone the repository from GitHub :
````
git clone https://github.com/qwyzex/qxBash
````
After that, `cd qxBash`. Then execute this command :
````
./qxbash.sh
````
## Reset
If you don't like the script, you can reset it by `cd wherever/you/clone/it`. After that run :
````
./reset.sh
````
It will promtp you with a `Warning`. This will reset `.bash_profile` to it's original state and remove `.bashrc` from your computer! Do not continue if you're not sure!
